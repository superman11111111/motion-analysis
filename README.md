# Motion Analysis with Neural Networks 

**Goal: Decent prototype that can take in any pov drone flight footage and make statements about the velocity, acceleration, position and rotation of the drone relative to the enviroment.**
Furthermore the system should be capable of predicting one or multiple paths with >90% certainty and predict the required changes to the current state of the system it has to make to archieve said path. 
The second condition is optional. 

Deadline: Taking into account that I have almost no experience with Computer Vision and little with Neural Networks in general, I will be very happy if this project will at least meet up with 50% of my expectations. Timeframe is 2 months.

Changes to the Deadline or extensions of the Goal are acceptable. **
